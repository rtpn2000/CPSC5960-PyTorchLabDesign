# CPSC5960-PyTorchLabDesign  

This repository consists of my Individual Study under the guidance of Prof. Pejman Khadivi, focusing on understanding PyTorch, its advantages, and practical applications in machine learning.  

#### Overview:  
The study was divided into two distinct phases suggested by the professor.  

###### Phase 1:  
Understanding PyTorch and Training a Simple Neural Network.  

- Learn about what exactly the framework is.
- Explore advantages over other frameworks.
- Train a simple neural network.

###### Phase 2:  
Designing Two Labs.  

- Design two educational labs that could be used for teaching purposes.
